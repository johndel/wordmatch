Wordmatch
=========

### Description
It finds words with the letters that you enter.

### Usage
1. Create a database with your credentials and put them in the solver.rb (your username and password)
2. Insert the words with `mysql -u your_username -pyour_password wordmatch < wordmatch.sql`
3. After it finishes, type `ruby solver.rb letters` some letters and it will find words with these letters in them

### Future
It takes approximately 25-30 seconds to match the words so it isn't so efficient. I'd like to make it faster.
